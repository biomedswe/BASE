# sequencing_project
A pipeline that will simplify your DNA and RNA-sequening. (what should we call it Minjun?, can you write something?)

## Requirements
- Platform: 
    - linux-64
    
    
## Installation and setup instructions

### 1. Clone the git archive:

```
git clone https://github.com/biomedswe/sequencing_project.git $HOME
```

### 2. Run sequencing.py and follow instructions in program

```
python sequencing.py (after navigating to $HOME/sequencing_project)
```
or
```
python $HOME/sequencing_project/sequencing.py
```

### 3. Copy your DNA-seq reads (in fasta/fastq format) into $HOME/sequencing_project/dna_seq/reads and/or RNA-seq reads into $HOME/sequencing_project/rna_seq/reads
